IPTVX for Android

## Features
- See https://github.com/adri1336/iptvone

## Install
1. Download latest .apk from releases.
2. Copy it to your Android device and install it.
3. Perhaps the system detects the application as not secure since it is not in the Play Store, in this case, click on continue.
4. App is designed for TVs, so I recommend to install in Android TV but you can use it in phones and tablets.
5. Enjoy.
